       <div class="tab-content">
        As a child, I always loved to draw. I would spend hours filling up notebooks with my own characters and stories, dreaming of one day becoming a manga artist. Despite some initial resistance from my family, who were concerned about my academic performance, I remained determined to pursue my passion. I spent countless hours studying the works of my favorite manga artists, experimenting with different styles and techniques, and honing my craft. By my teenage years, I was already gaining recognition in the local manga community and was well on my way to achieving my dream of becoming a successful manga artist. Looking back, I'm grateful for the support and encouragement of my friends and mentors who helped me to develop my skills and find my own unique voice as an artist.
        During my teenage years, my passion for manga only grew stronger. I spent every spare moment drawing and writing, working to improve my skills and perfect my craft. I became a regular attendee of local anime and manga conventions, where I could meet other fans and showcase my artwork. I also started submitting my work to publishers, hoping to get my foot in the door and break into the industry. Although I faced my fair share of rejection and disappointment, I refused to give up. I kept pushing myself to create new and exciting stories, constantly seeking feedback and striving to improve. Looking back, I'm proud of how far I've come and grateful for the lessons I learned during those formative years. They helped shape me into the artist I am today, and gave me the determination and resilience I need to succeed in this challenging but rewarding field.

       <div class="tab-content">
        My work life can be both exciting and challenging. I typically work long hours, often into the early hours of the morning, in order to meet my publisher's deadlines. Each chapter of my manga can take several weeks to complete, and requires careful planning and attention to detail in order to create a compelling story that will resonate with readers. On a typical day, I spend hours hunched over my drawing tablet, sketching out each panel and carefully inking the lines. Between drawing and writing, I'm also responsible for submitting my work to my publisher, negotiating contracts, and promoting my manga on social media. Although the workload can be intense, I'm passionate about my craft and find great fulfillment in bringing my characters to life and seeing how readers respond to my work. However, it's important to take breaks and prioritize self-care in order to avoid burnout and maintain my overall well-being.

        <div class="tab-content">
            Every project is a unique and challenging experience. Each manga presents its own set of creative and technical obstacles that require careful planning and execution. From developing characters and world-building to crafting dialogue and pacing the story, there are countless elements to consider in every chapter. One of the most rewarding aspects of my work is seeing how readers respond to my stories. It's incredibly gratifying to hear from fans who have connected with my characters and been moved by their struggles and triumphs. Of course, there are also challenges and setbacks along the way. Deadlines can be stressful, and there are times when I've had to make difficult decisions or revisions to meet the demands of my publisher. But despite the ups and downs, I wouldn't trade this job for anything. Being a manga artist is not just a job, but a way of life, and I'm grateful for every opportunity to create something new and share it with the world.
